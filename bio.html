        <p class="title1">About the work</p>
        <p><em>Alexis Madeline is a director and production designer based in NYC. Madeline's artistic exploration delves into the intricate tapestry of human nature as she perceives it. A central theme her work revolves around capturing the garment as an extension of both the body and mind. Through the utilization of the moving image, she transcends the conventional boundaries of the medium by employing it not only as a mean of expression but also as a unique perspective to observe.
        Emerging from a traditional fine arts background Madeline's older work is composed of primarily figure paintings. The study of the anatomy of the human body plays a vital role into the ideation process of her newer works. Madeline's creative journey is marked by an abiding fascination with the essence of our humanity—what makes us undeniably real and what defines us as humans. In navigating these concepts, she contemplates the fluidity of time, exploring its essence in the tangible reality and through the lens. This exploration extends to the physicality of the human form, delving into the intricate realms of what makes us human.</em></p>

        <p><em> Madeline's art serves as a study, a nuanced exploration of the interconnectedness between our perceptual experience, the passing of time, and the tangible elements that constitute our human identity. </em></p>

        <p>From the artist:</p>
        <p>My name is Alexis Madeline. I am a 2nd year student at the parsons school of design studying Fine Arts and Screen Studies. My main focus is studying fashion through the lens of a camera, I have worked as a freelance videographer and graphic designer for three years.
            
        Originally coming from a background in painting, I found myself drawn to time based mediums due to my discomfort with the concept of control. Seeking out artistic outlets to control the uncontrollable led me to discover a passion for videography. I can alter the perception of reality by overstepping the boundaries of what is transient and eternal. I find beauty in the rawness of life, and I choose to celebrate that with my work. I invite audiences into the world of my mind, of understanding the concept of reality and whether or not it is subjective.</p>
        <p>"What is real? How can it be determined? Is reality a measurable concept? Is it subjective?" are all questions that i invite viewers to ask themselves when viewing my work. I aim to cause people to second guess there surroundings, and be more aware of the world around them.</p>

        <p>I am fascinated with the concept of time. The idea that time is uncontrollable has made me feel stuck, driving me to find ways to control it. My fixation on finding control in the uncontrollable led me to discover a passion for film. I began to see it as a medium to utilize time as a regulation device. With videography, I can manipulate aspects of what is real. I can alter the perception of reality by overstepping the boundaries of what is transient and eternal. I find beauty in the rawness of life, and I choose to celebrate that with my work.</p>

        <p>Our bodies reflect life in its purest form, making it the perfect subject for capturing the rawness of life. I focus on defining what is human through a focus on fashion. I am interested in studying fashion because of its impermanence; seeing a garment worn a particular way is rarely controlled. It exists within the constraints of mortality; as the fabric ages, it may fray or fall apart. A garment is seldom still. The moving image makes the garment viewable as a state of life.
        In my film, "Flesh Unbound," I focused on the garment as an extension of the body, serving as a second skin for the wearer. The film is one of many that I plan on including in my study of the relationship between the garment and the body. I chose to shoot scenes across different deconstructed sites. The elements of broken-apart concrete, paint splattered on walls, and mud on the floor alluded to the mood of what is raw and messy about life. The immersive aspects of the cinematic experience best translate the world that I want my viewers to see, distorting the portrayal of the body through the second eye of the lens.</p>
        <p>My representation of the body has translated directly from my background in fine art—the contrast of painting a figure versus capturing it through film has deepened my understanding of form. Growing up, I studied human anatomy by painting and viewing the figure in fragments. Having a background in fine arts has benefited me tremendously, allowing me to transform and manipulate my previous studies to inform my current projects. Obtaining the ability to visualize an idea on paper, whether a storyboard or the composition of a specific shot, has been vital to my creative process. These techniques also help me think of my work as fragments of time and how that notion ties to image creation. As a self-taught artist, I have been able to develop the artistic style that I have matured throughout my life as an artist. At Parsons, I study Fine Art as a mode of creating through one or many different mediums. We reflect upon the intention of work as our ideas are criticized, refined, and ultimately improved. Within two years, I have been allowed to pursue classes in fashion, photography, graphic design, and fashion marketing, along with several other artistic studies. The freedom to experiment has been incredibly beneficial in my journey to mature and professionalize my voice as an artist. By gaining a range of creative skill sets, I have become a well-rounded artist, allowing me to take on various responsibilities on set confidently.</p>
